# hello-world
This is my tutorial repository.

Hey,

My name is Kendall. I am learning GitHub, Unity, and JavaScript. I am enrolling in a coding bootcamp soon so I want to get a leg up. I am interested in game design and am already working as a programmer and Indigenous language consultant for Raindrop Games.
